# Project Name

### React-Clicky-Game

Deployed app  [here](https:///).

# Project Description:

This game is a memory game built with React. The goal is not to click on any picture more than once. 

* The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.
* The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score would be reset to 0 if user clicks the same image more than once.
* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page would shuffle themselves in a random order.
* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game would restart.

# Technologies Used: 

React, ES6, Materialize, Bootstrap
